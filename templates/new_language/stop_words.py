# Documentation: http://spacy.io/docs/usage/adding-languages#stop-words
# To improve readability, words should be ordered alphabetically and separated
# by spaces and newlines. When adding stop words from an online source, always
# include the link in a comment. Make sure to proofread and double-check the
# words – lists available online are often known to contain mistakes.
